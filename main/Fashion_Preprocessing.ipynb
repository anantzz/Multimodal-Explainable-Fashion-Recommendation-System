My earlobes would swell, turn red, and bleed immediately after inserting even \"hypoallergenic\" earrings.  I\\'ve tried other brands, such as Simply Whispers, which I really wanted to love, but I simply couldn\\'t wear them.  I\\'d given up and given away most of my earrings and hadn\\'t bought or tried any earrings for a few years.\\n\\nWhen these first arrived, I had trouble inserting them because my earlobes had almost grown closed, and I traumatized my ears a bit.  Over the next several days, I removed them at night, then irritated my ears again when I reinserted them in the morning.  Finally, I decided to just leave them in and allow my ears to heal, and that has worked just fine.  Now my ears have healed, and I haven\\'t bothered to remove the earrings for a couple of weeks.\\n\\nI noticed that in a review for one of the other styles, the reviewer had two complaints: that the ad appeared misleading in that it looked like you were purchasing three pairs of earrings, and that the 3mm size was tiny.  So take note:  you are ordering just one pair of earrings, and the 3mm (mini) size earrings are very small - take a look at a ruler to get an idea - but they provide an understated bit of sparkle.\\n\\nI highly recommend these for people with metal allergies - I\\'m planning to get another pair.',\n",

Many of my runs have taken place in temperatures within the 20s, and while the gloves are not winter gloves, they are working out. My hands are cold as I start my run and the tips of my fingers do sting initially, but after about half a mile or a mile, I've warmed up enough that my hands become comfortable. In fact, I think if I were wearing anything heavier, the warmth of the gloves might become too much. These allow me to go for 8-mile runs without feeling like I have to take them off. As long as you're okay starting your run with slightly cold hands, these could be for you.\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been using these gloves on and off for about a month now, and so far I've found them to be a great purchase. I usually go for runs around 5 a.m., and this has allowed me to test them out in temps that have resided in the mid-30s. So far, so good. They do the job. If I remember, I'll post an update once the weather gets even colder.\\n\\nMy only concern is the fit. I'm an average size guy, and there's something a little uncomfortable about the way they fit, as if the fingers could've been cut lower, that makes me think I'd have an issue with them if I were a taller guy with bigger hands. That being said, I'd purchase these again if I had to do it all over again. At this price point, you can't beat them.\",\n",

They will be used for a costume getup (no, it\\'s not a drag outfit!).\\n\\nAnother thing I quickly discovered... maybe this is just because I have never worn knee high boots or heels of any kind before...  but when you stand flat and do not move, the \"plane\" of the bottom of the boot is wrong.  First, the toe plate... it\\'s not so much curved as it is a slight \"V\" shape.  It is possible to stand on your toes, simply by leaning forward and shifting your weight a little.  When you lean back again, the heel comes back down to the ground and your toes roll up a little.  This may be difficult to imagine, and again, it may just be because I have not worn heels before.  But it seems like it should have a flatter sole.\\n\\nThe \\'patent leather\\' is VERY thin.  Not that I expected much, it\\'s a $50 boot, not a $500 one.

I am one of those guys who just sweats a lot. To ensure the shirts the world sees stay alive for longer, i wear these guys underneath. If I were to rate these shirts lower for any reason, it would be that the collars at the side of my neck wrinkles, But that's specific to me and my body, because my neck is larger than the body size the shirt is built for. At the V of the neck, the shirt maintains it's structure, rests comfortably and it's so thick that I notice it, even when it's under a shirt, a tie and a v-neck sweater. I had a thought of buying another shirt to see if these could be beat, but I can't see the reason to risk it. I realized today that I may be over the clock on buying these and I was. I told myself to replace them every 6 months and it's been a year. Did these shirts lose their color? After a year of my use, and zero bleach, yes. But I don't think there is a single white shirt on the planet that can endure a year with me, my sweat, my abuse and my cleaning techniques. The color fading is the only reason I remembered I needed to replace them.\\n\\nOLDER Revew:\\nI wear white undershirts every day to extend the life of my expensive collard shirts.
